## Greetings 👋

Name's Doe, I'm an aviation enthusiast currently studying to become an airline pilot. In addition, I pursue programming as a hobby and have a passion for music. 
I occasionally perform as a vocalist for local bands, so some of my recordings may be available somewhere on the internet.

## Active Stuff 🖥️
- Developing a custom HaxeFlixel build (currently on hold).
- Producing music for singles and albums.
- Working on the development of several Linux distributions (excluding personal projects).
- Studying cybersecurity.
